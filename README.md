# Biku's Dots

## Currently underworking progress
>Restructuring for Prebuilts/Existing Systems and Building from the ground up.

## Requirements:
Install the needed dependencies (usually these are installed by default):
```
curl wget
```

## Misc Means Aesthetics:
- `cava`
- `neofetch`

## Usage:
Clone this repo:
```
git clone <this repo> ~/.dotfiles
```
Install:
```
sudo ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```

`cd` then use `stow` for the folder in need:
```
stow <folder>
```

> These are for old archive_scripts that I'm gonna use for bspwm and hyprland bootstraping environments 
### Currently Working on an installer for 3 Bases:
- [ ] Debian/Ubuntu
- [ ] Arch
- [x] Minimal (Terminal Utils Only)

### My personal dotfiles with:
- [ ] i3
- [ ] Sway
- [ ] Zsh
- [ ] X

> Notes: I'll try to make the system not be dependent on `stow` in the future.
